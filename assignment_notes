The springboot application can run locally or in a container.
To run the application in a container built the jar first then run docker-compose up
In both cases the application exposes port 8080.


Users can execute http request using the following credentials:
user: someuser
password: psw

http://localhost:8080/travel/locations

returns all locations. When a translation is available in the localized language: name, description and language are returned
in the localized language. Otherwise english is returned if present. Otherwise fields are left empty.


http://localhost:8080/travel/locations/{type}/{code}

will return the location for the given code and type, with localized information if present.

Example
http://localhost:8080/travel/locations/city/YYT

will return:
{"code":"YYT","name":"Saint Johns","language":"EN","type":"city","latitude":47.61833,"longitude":-52.75222,"description":"Saint Johns (YYT)","parentCode":"CA","parentType":"country"}

Embedded H2 database is not protected for convenience.

http://localhost:8080/actuator/health is also unprotected
http://localhost:8080/actuator/stats is implementing an end point with the required metrics and it is protected with the following credentials:
use:ops
password:psw

a Client API contains a main method which can be run and prints all the airport in the US.

For lack of time I did not implement unit tests.
